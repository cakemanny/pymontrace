In priority order:

- [x] Add <3.12 support
- [ ] Support targets in Linux containers
- [ ] Tracer / tracee communication. i.e. the tool should be there primarily
      for observing behaviour. Want to see it in pymontrace stdout.
- [ ] Trace target which has not had pymontrace already pip installed.
- [ ] Clean up C code (specific TODOs are within)
- [ ] Use Py_AddPendingCall on Darwin too

- [o] Factor code into tracer and tracee parts

- [ ] Trace many targets at once. Main need: trace forking servers.

- [ ] Firm up the language / interface.
      - [ ] Create buffer spaces to support aggregations?
- [ ] func probes (entry, exit, exception, yield, unwind, resume, ...)

- [ ] Support FreeBSD + jails , Illumos + zones, ...
- [ ] musl support on Linux ...
- [ ] Rewrite the C code in Rust
