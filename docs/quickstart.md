# Quick Start

## Installation

pymontrace may be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymontrace/)
either using `pip` or `pipx` as the situation calls.

```shell
pip install pymontrace
```

```shell
pipx install pymontrace
```

It's also possible to run without an explicit install using `pipx run` or
`uvx`.
