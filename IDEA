Downside... no one-liners
Upside... familiar to python users


    pymontrace -p 123 -l
    pymontrace -p 123 -e '/expr/ { ... }'

If python, then could define some sort of api to use in probe context:

    # This would send the data back to the controlling process for printing
    pmt.print(a, b, c)


-c
Instead of running the program in process we could start a python subprocess
with a modified PYTHONPATH ...
